# Tabglutton

**Devour a sprawling tab list.** Close duplicates, file the keepers into Obsidian —
or hand the whole backlog to a coding agent and let it triage.

For Firefox based browsers like [Zen Browser](https://zen-browser.app/) and Chromium browsers like [Helium](https://helium.computer/).

<!-- DEMO SLOT
     These stills are honest but static. The asset worth having is a ~20s screen
     recording of the cockpit emptying a real backlog: filter → select → Devour →
     notes landing in Obsidian → Undo. Record at 1440×900, export GIF under 10 MB
     (GitHub's attachment cap), drop it at docs/media/demo.gif, and put it above
     the <picture> block below.

## The problem

Too much content, so little time! Tabglutton is for those voracious consumers of information
who open dozens of blog posts, X posts, and articles every day out of interest where discovery
outpaces ingestion. Tabglutton helps manage the feast of tabs you may or may not want to
imbibe, acting as a curator, deduplicator, and dashboard. It even connects to your Obsidian vault
to automate second brain extension, acting as a batch ingest version of Obsidian Web Clipper.
Connect to your agent of choice to triage high signal content, determined by your existing interests and pursuits.

## What it does

### 1. Dedup

The toolbar badge counts duplicate tabs in scope. Open the popup or the cockpit and they
are the first thing on the list: a **Duplicates** section, one group per canonical URL,
with the copy that survives marked `keep` and every other copy sitting under it — so the
badge's number is something you can read before you act on it. The keeper is chosen by
`lastAccessed`, then `active`, then `pinned`.

Close them all with **Dedup**, a whole set with its **Select extras** button, or the lot
with **Select all _n_** on the section rule — the last two put the copies in the normal
selection, so they can be devoured into Obsidian instead of just closed. A toast offers
Undo for ~6 seconds and restores tabs to their original positions.

If you would rather be told than check the badge, Settings → Deduplication has an optional
notice: once the count reaches a threshold you pick, a small Tabglutton pill appears in the
corner of the page you are on with the count, a **Dedup** button, and the same Undo. It is
in-browser UI, not a system notification, and it announces each pile once — it returns only
after the count has dropped below the threshold and climbed back, at most every 30 minutes.
Off by default.

URLs are canonicalized first (`src/normalize.ts`): lowercased host, `www.` and trailing
slash stripped, tracking params (`utm_*`, `fbclid`, `gclid`, `si`, …) dropped, remaining
params sorted, and optionally the `#fragment` removed.

### 2. Devour → Obsidian

Select tabs and hit **Devour**. Each one is read through
[Defuddle](https://github.com/kepano/defuddle) — the same extractor behind Obsidian's own
Web Clipper — formatted as markdown with frontmatter (title, source URL, author, site,
published date), filed into your vault under `Clippings/`, and closed.

> [!NOTE]
> You can include the Clippings directory in your main vault, or put it in a secondary
> agent managed vault (LLM-wiki style), where you can do additional agent-driven synthesis to avoid polluting
> your primary vault with noise.

The full-screen **Devour cockpit** (`Alt+Shift+D`) is the workspace for this: tabs grouped
by host, an inspector previewing exactly where each note will land, and keyboard triage
throughout — `j`/`k` to move, `space` to toggle, `d` to devour, `x` to close, `/` to filter.

### 3. Agent bridge <a id="agent-bridge"></a>

This is the part that isn't like other tab extensions.

Tabglutton ships **Gullet**, a local MCP server. Turn the bridge on in settings, run its
one-time token setup command, and point Claude Code or Codex at
`bunx tabglutton-gullet`; your agent can then work your actual open tabs:

| Tool         | What it does                                            |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `tabs_list`  | Metadata for every tab in scope — cheap across hundreds |
| `tab_read`   | Full Defuddle extraction of one page                    |
| `tabs_load`  | Wake tabs the browser unloaded, so they become readable |
| `tab_clip`   | File a tab where Devour files it, optionally closing it |
| `tabs_close` | Close a batch, returning a `batchId`                    |
| `undo_close` | Reverse any batch                                       |

So "go through my 400 tabs, tell me what's worth keeping, clip the good ones and close the
noise" becomes a thing you can actually ask for. The agent triages on metadata first, reads
only the survivors, and every close is reversible.

**It is deliberately hard to make this dangerous.** The bridge is off until you enable it.
It binds loopback only, authenticates with a shared token that never crosses the wire
(both ends prove knowledge of it against a nonce the other side chose), and checks the
extension origin. Waking tabs is a _second_, separate opt-in, because it's the only method
that acts on a page rather than reading one. Nothing is ever closed that the undo log
couldn't put back — if a tab can't be recorded, it's left open and reported as skipped.

Setup lives in [`gullet/README.md`](gullet/README.md); the design rationale, wire protocol,
and a long list of hard-won browser quirks are in [`docs/BRIDGE.md`](docs/BRIDGE.md).

## Install

**Firefox and Zen** — [on addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/tabglutton/).
**Chrome and Chromium** — [on the Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/dlploljcggbdcjcaiigmoagonmehglhi).

Two ways to run it from source:

**From source** (either browser):

```bash
bun install
bun run build              # → dist-firefox/ and dist-chrome/
```

- **Firefox / Zen** — `about:debugging` → This Firefox → Load Temporary Add-on → pick any
  file in `dist-firefox/`. For an install that survives restarts, see
  [signing](#dogfooding-a-signed-build).
- **Chrome** — `chrome://extensions` → enable Developer mode → Load unpacked →
  `dist-chrome/`. Chrome ignores the manifest's suggested shortcuts, so bind
  `Alt+Shift+G` (popup) and `Alt+Shift+D` (cockpit) yourself at
  `chrome://extensions/shortcuts`.

**Dev loop:**

```bash
bun start                  # build + launch Zen with the extension loaded
bun run start:firefox      # same, against regular Firefox
bun run start:chrome       # same, against Chromium
bun run check              # typecheck + format + lint + test — run before committing
```

## Scope

Zen has no workspace API for extensions, so "active workspace" is a heuristic:
`tab.hidden === false`. If it looks broken (every tab in the window reads as visible) the
popup warns you and you can fall back to "current window only" in settings. Regular Firefox
and Chrome have no workspaces, so they use current-window scope directly.

## Privacy

No analytics, no telemetry, no remote server, no account. Page content is extracted
in-page and goes exactly two places: your Obsidian vault, and — only if you turn the bridge
on — a loopback socket to an MCP server running on your own machine. Anything an agent
reads over that socket goes wherever _that_ agent sends it, typically its model provider;
the bridge is how you hand pages to a tool you already trust, not a channel of ours. The
extension requests no permissions beyond what dedup and clipping need.

## Settings

Right-click the toolbar icon → Manage Extension → Preferences.

- **Strip URL fragment** (default on) — treat `page#a` and `page#b` as the same URL.
- **Extra params to strip** — additional query params beyond the built-in tracking list.
- **Scope** — active workspace (Zen heuristic) or current window only.
- **Obsidian vault** — required for Devour; ignored by dedup.
- **Agent bridge** — off by default. Enable, generate a token, optionally allow tab loading.

## Dogfooding a signed build

To run on your real profile so it survives restarts, sign through Mozilla AMO's _unlisted_
channel (signed, not publicly listed). Create an AMO account, generate JWT credentials,
then:

```bash
cp .env.sample .env        # fill in WEB_EXT_API_KEY / WEB_EXT_API_SECRET
bun run sign               # builds, uploads, signs → web-ext-artifacts/*.xpi
```

Drag the `.xpi` onto `about:addons`. Upgrades are in-place and preserve extension storage.
Versions are `major.minor.patch.build`; bump the release triple normally and let
`bun run sign:dev` own the fourth part.

## Architecture

TypeScript compiled by Bun into `dist-firefox/` and `dist-chrome/` from one shared source
tree. `manifest.json` describes the Firefox shape and is patched in memory for Chrome;
`src/target.ts` is the single compile-time switch. Chrome additionally gets
`webextension-polyfill` inlined into a bundled service worker.

| Path                                         | Role                                                    |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/background.ts`                          | Event wiring, badge, tab readiness                      |
| `src/dedup.ts` · `src/normalize.ts`          | Duplicate planning and URL canonicalization             |
| `src/clip-current.ts` · `src/clip-format.ts` | Defuddle extraction → markdown → `obsidian://`          |
| `src/bridge-*.ts` · `src/undo-log.ts`        | Agent bridge client, wire protocol, reversible closes   |
| `gullet/`                                    | MCP server + loopback WebSocket hub (zero dependencies) |
| `popup/` · `options/` · `onboarding/`        | UI surfaces, sharing one token system                   |

Contributor notes are in [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) — including a fairly brutal catalogue of
cross-browser behaviours that cost real debugging time (Chrome minting new tab ids on
discard, Gecko's failed-WebSocket reconnect penalty, CSP silently upgrading `ws://` to
`wss://`, and more).
